# web-api-challenge

In this challenge I created a quiz out of javascript. When the user takes the quiz, they are presented with a question. If they answer correctly then they are presented with another question until the questions are exhausted. If they enter an incorrect answer then 1 hp is removed from their total. Continued incorrect answers will remove hp until none remains. Once the quiz is completed, then they can enter their initials and the score will be displayed.
